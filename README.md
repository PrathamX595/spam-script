# Spam Script

Have you ever wanted to prank a friend by sending them a burst of messages they won’t forget? With this automated spammer script, you can do just that!

This Python script leverages **PyAutoGUI** to send a customizable message repeatedly. Just enter the message you want to spam and how many times to send it—then watch the script take over!

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: Please use this responsibly! Spamming without permission can be annoying and may be against the rules of certain platforms.

## How It Works
1. **Enter Your Message**: Type in the message you want to spam.
2. **Set Spam Count**: Specify how many times the message should be sent.
3. **Choose Your Target Window**: You’ll have a 5-second countdown to move your cursor to the desired input box.
4. **Let the Games Begin**: Once the timer ends, the script will start sending your message for the specified count. ヾ( ･`⌓´･)ﾉﾞ
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/): Install it  with the following command:
    ```bash
        pip install pyautogui
## Running the Script
To run the script, you have two options:

1. **Run the Executable**:
   - If you’ve converted the script to an executable, just double-click to start.
2. **Run from Script**:
   - If you’d like to edit or customize the script, open `script.py` and run it with:
     ```bash
     python script.py
     ```
## Notes
- **Preparation**: After entering the message and spam count, you’ll have 5 seconds to place the cursor where you want the spam to go.
- **Enjoy and Use Responsibly**: This tool is for fun, so be considerate of others and avoid spamming unnecessarily.
